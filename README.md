===============
**DEPRECATION NOTICE: This repo has been sunsetted in favor of [Core API Lib](https://www.google.com/search?q=kurtosis-core-api-lib)! Go users should migrate their imports to using Core API Lib; Typescript users need not do anything.**

This repo contains clients for communicating with the Kurtosis API server, which both testsuites and Kurtosis Modules will use to manipulate the test environment.
