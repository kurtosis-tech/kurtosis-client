* Update API container service proto definition adding the `relative_service_dirpath` field in `RegisterServiceResponse` and `GetServiceInfoResponse`

### Changes
* Remove `RegisterStaticFiles()`, `GenerateFiles()` and `LoadStaticFiles()` methods from protobuf `ApiContainerService`

### Breaking Changes
* Combine `ContainerCreationConfig` and `ContainerRunConfig` in the new `ContainerConfig` which contains all the necessary information used to create and run a service container

* Update `NetworkCtx.AddService()` method replacing the `containerCreationConfig` param and the `generateRunConfigFunc` with the `containerConfigSupplier` param
  * Users should update `NetworkCtx.AddService()` calls passing it now the `containerConfigSupplier` which is an anonymous function that should be created to dynamically generate the `containerConfig` object 
* Replace `enclaveDataVolMountpointHere` and `enclaveDataVolMountpointOnServiceContainer` in `ServiceContext` fields with a new field called `sharedDirectory` with `SharedPath` type
  * Users should use the `SharedPath` in the `sharedDirectory` field to get the service directory absolute paths
* Removed the `ServiceContext.GenerateFiles()` and the `ServiceContext.LoadStaticFiles()` methods
  * Users should manually create, generate and copy static and dynamic files into the service container with the help of the new `SharedDirectory` object

### Changes
* Renamed the `GeneratedFileFilepaths.AbsoluteFilepathOnTestsuiteContainer` -> `AbsoluteFilepathHere` (since the code may not be running on a testsuite with Kurtosis Interactive)

### Fixes
* Fixed broken documentation links now that testsuite API lib has been extracted from Kurtosis Libs

### Breaking Changes

### Breaking Changes
* Renamed the `core_api_bindings` package -> `kurtosis_core_rpc_api_bindings`

# 0.6.0
### Breaking Changes
* Replaced the argument `ContainerConfigFactory` in `AddService`and `AddServiceToPartition`with two arguments `ContainerCreationConfig`and an anonymous function which should returns `ContainerRunConfig`type
  * Users should use the `ContainerCreationConfig` struct, and the function that was defined in `GetRunConfig` in the `ContainerConfigFactory` implementations as the new arguments
* Removed `ContainerConfigFactory` interface; users should instead feed the `ContainerCreationConfig` and `ContainerRunConfig` values directly to `NetworkContext.AddService` or `NetworkContext.AddServiceToPartition`

# 0.5.0
### Features
* Test volume mountpoints are now optional (with a sensible default) when creating `ContainerCreationConfig`s

### Changes
* Added build.sh script inside of typescript/ that takes in .ts files and outputs a single .js file
* Updated the `release.sh` script to use the changelog script

### Fixes
* Fix broken links to `kurtosis-libs` inside the docs

### Breaking Changes
* The `ContainerCreationConfigBuilder` constructor no longer takes in a test volume mountpoint
* Added a `ContainerCreationConfigBuilder.WithTestVolumeMountpoint` for specifying the test volume mountpoint, which should be used instead if the default test volume mountpoint of `/kurtosis-test-volume` isn't acceptable

# 0.4.0
### Features
* Added the `LoadStaticFiles` endpoint to the API container's API for copying static files to a service's filespace
* Added a `LoadStaticFiles` command to the bulk command API
* Added a corresponding `ServiceContext.loadStaticFiles` for calling the API container's `LoadStaticFiles` endpoint
* `ContainerCreationConfigBuilder` now has a new method, `withStaticFiles`, which defines static files that the service will use
    * This function takes in a set, whose elements should be static file IDs corresponding to the static file IDs defined in your testsuite

### Breaking Changes
* `ContainerConfigFactory.getRunConfig` now takes an extra map argument, `staticFileFilepaths`, whose keys correspond to the static file IDs defined in `ContainerCreationConfigBuilder.withStaticFiles` and whose values are the filepaths _on the service container_ where those static files can be found
    * If your service needs static files, you can use this map to set your container's ENTRYPOINT, CMD, and environment variable parameters appropriately

# 0.3.0
### Features
* Added new method `GetServiceInfo` in `api_container_service.proto` file
* Added new method `GetServiceContext` in `NetworkContext` which returns relevant information about the service

### Changes
* Removed the services map from `NetworkContext` which converts it in stateless network representation

### Breaking Changes
* Removed `Service` interface; users should communicate with the service directly or use a custom client (e.g. ElasticsearchClient)
* Removed `GetService` from `NetworkContext` users can use `GetServiceContext` to get relevant service's information
* Removed `AvailabilityChecker` class in the returned values of `AddService` and `AddServiceToPartition`; users should either call the service directly to check availability or use the `NetworkContext.WaitForAvailability` method
* Removed `GetServiceCreatingFunc` from `ContainerCreationConfig`type

* Don't panic when a user passes in a null partition connections map to `NetworkContxt.repartitionNetwork`

# 0.2.1
### Features
* Added a new method `WaitForEndpointAvailability` in NetworkContext that can be used to wait until a service's endpoint becomes available

### Changes
